# quick_road_patch
📌 Overview

The Quick Road Patch Rover is a semi-autonomous robotic system designed to detect potholes and assist in road repair operations. It improves road safety by identifying damaged areas and supporting controlled filling of potholes.

⚙️ Features

Real-time pothole detection

WiFi-based remote control

Automated patching mechanism

3D-printed robotic arm

🛠️ Hardware Used

Arduino UNO

ESP8266 WiFi module

Ultrasonic sensors

Solenoid valve

3D-printed robotic arm

🔧 Working Principle

Ultrasonic sensors detect potholes based on depth variations. The rover is remotely controlled via WiFi using ESP8266. Once positioned, a solenoid valve and robotic arm mechanism dispense filling material into the pothole.

🚀 Applications

Smart road maintenance systems

Urban infrastructure monitoring

Accident prevention solutions
